### The Journ(ey)al

#### Day 1 (11/11)

I'm thinking of trying to make a game similar to the Tap Tap series (which for some reason doesn't exist anymore on the App Store), where you tap on incoming "beats" (orbs) that come down the screen according to the beat of the song. This used to be one of my favorite pastimes, but now it's gone (replaced by others, which are fun, but just don't have that same nostalgia. I realize now that the Tap Tap games may have been removed due to infringing rights for privately-owned music, but I won't let that taint my memories of the game).

I think I'll have to use buttons on the arduino, since I don't have enough photoresistors to imitate the "touch" or just actual touch sensors. I have no idea how I'll program the orb sequences (I may have to hardcode this data, using a CSV file or something) but I'm thinking of making a scoring system based on how close to the center of the orb you are when you press the button (I realize that there might be delays between the arduino and program but that's something I'll figure out later).

What I know I'll need is a start page (instructions & stuff), a music selection page, and the actual game screen. I'll also need to use a sound file library and find a way to handle the rhythm bit (if I can make it automatically, that'd be even better). This time, I'll figure out how to make those separate files and use them so it's easier to read for others (in my defense, I used Sublime so I just collapsed everything I didn't need).

Why am I starting so early? There are a *lot* of things that are coming up soon, so I thought it best to get things done faster. I remember how ~~terrible-and-sleep-depriving-to-the-point-of-breakdowns~~ exhausting it was because all my assignments and midterms were in the same week, and I don't want to go through that again. However, I have a bunch of stuff due this week so I may not get back to this until next week.
