### The Journ(ey)al

[Day 1](journal.md#day-1)

#### Day 1 (11/11)

I'm thinking of trying to make a game similar to the Tap Tap series (which for some reason doesn't exist anymore on the App Store), where you tap on incoming "beats" (orbs) that come down the screen according to the beat of the song. This used to be one of my favorite pastimes, but now it's gone (replaced by others, which are fun, but just don't have that same nostalgia. I realize now that the Tap Tap games may have been removed due to infringing rights for privately-owned music, but I won't let that taint my memories of the game).

I think I'll have to use buttons on the arduino, since I don't have enough photoresistors to imitate the "touch" or just actual touch sensors. I have no idea how I'll program the orb sequences (I may have to hardcode this data, using a CSV file or something) but I'm thinking of making a scoring system based on how close to the center of the orb you are when you press the button (I realize that there might be delays between the arduino and program but that's something I'll figure out later).

What I know I'll need is a start page (instructions & stuff), a music selection page, and the actual game screen. I'll also need to use a sound file library and find a way to handle the rhythm bit (if I can make it automatically, that'd be even better). This time, I'll figure out how to make those separate files and use them so it's easier to read for others (in my defense, I used Sublime so I just collapsed everything I didn't need).

Why am I starting so early? There are a *lot* of things that are coming up soon, so I thought it best to get things done faster. I remember how ~~terrible-and-sleep-depriving-to-the-point-of-breakdowns~~ exhausting it was because all my assignments and midterms were in the same week, and I don't want to go through that again. However, I have a bunch of stuff due this week so I may not get back to this until next week.

#### Day 2 (11/20)

So, some mistakes were made and I didn't realize that we had another assignment on top of the musical instrument one. I had to work on that, so I didn't do much in terms of the final project. Right now, I'm really wondering what I should do. Should I continue with this idea? If so, I have a general gist of how I want to do the project, in terms of the menu and the game. However, it seems kind of... boring. Yes, it's cool and all, but for some reason it doesn't feel all that innovative. Yeah, it's a knockoff game, but right now that's just about all I can do. Thinking of making the menu as a bubble shooter kind of thing but... Whoa. I think I may have lost motivation for this game. That was fast. I'm going to think of new ideas and get back to this.

#### Day 3 (11/22)

I said it jokingly in my assignment, but what if I actually made an escape room or something? Like have a breadboard of random sensors and things, then use each of those? It's fun, and it won't be a knockoff of anything. The question, however, is how to randomize something like that. I know it's kind of going overboard, but I want to think about things like that as well. In the case that I don't randomize it, that means that I need to implement some kind of feature that'll make it exciting. Maybe a timer.

#### Day 4 (11/24)

Speaking of timers... Not a lot of time left until I need to start working on the project for **sure**. I don't want things to turn out like last time, so I need to pick an idea and stick to it. I'm not doing Tap Tap, I might do an escape room, and I have an idea for one of the things. It's a vault where you place a cup of water on top of the dial to see if there's a click. Really cool, saw it on a TV show. Want to implement that. Also, what the prof said about using the same sensor or switch for multiple functions made me think about how I might be able to use the same things for different purposes...

#### Day 5 (11/26)

A bank heist. That's what I can make. Thought of it just now, as everything clicked together. It's fun, new, and innovative. I can also add a timer so that people need to move fast (and hopefully miss out on any bugs that might exist hehe). The question now is what features there should be and how I can make it work. Last time, all I needed was one button. But this time, I'm thinking of using almost all of the sensors that I have. This is gonna be a tough one. Will I have enough time? If not, I can just stick with the vault by itself (meaning I'll work on that first, then go to the others if I have time). Yeah, it works. Eskettit (let's get it).
