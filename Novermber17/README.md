### Assignment 9: Adjustable Keyboard

#### Preface

Yes, this is what I was planning on doing for last week's assignment. I looked at the prompt for the production assignment and realized that the project I had in mind was actually a better fit for this assignment than for the last. And so, I decided that I would do the adjustable keyboard for this assignment.

#### The Idea

Well, this kinda came from the whole reading about physical computing, that keyboards with touch or sensors are very common. Unfortunately, I don't actually have any touch sensors and the way that I was planning on doing touch (using photoresistors) required me having more than one photoresistor (this is why I wish we had access to the entire IM lab and its equipment )': ), so I ended up having to use buttons. *Ugh*. I'm sorry, it's just that these buttons aren't really an ideal form of input because they're so... *clacky* and hard to use.

Anyway, merely making a keyboard seemed way too simple, so I decided to add a potentiometer to add an adjustable aspect to it, so that by turning the potentiometer you could get lower/higher notes along the scale. This idea was inspired by how the keyboards are like in Garage Band for iOS devices, where you swipe to reach higher scales and stuff.
