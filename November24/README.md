### Assignment 10: Flappy Bird Knockoff

So. I don't actually know if this will work, but I want to make a remake of Flappy Bird using a button. It's a super simple interaction, I *know*, but it's kinda hard to get creative with this, given the limited skills, time, and resources that I have. I thought of making an escape room, Escape Room 2.0, but that'll either be the final project or just something I make in my free time.

#### The Idea and Result

I don't really think I need to introduce Flappy Bird, but it's basically a game where you tap the screen to make a bird on the screen fly. Every tap makes it go up by a certain amount, and if you don't tap the screen it'll fall to the ground. Also, there are obstacles that you need to avoid hitting, too.
