#### Assignment 8: Adjustable Keyboard

I have no idea if this is going to work, but what I have in mind is basically a keyboard you turn on and can change the octaves using the potentiometer. Once again, I have no idea if this is gonna work because I need to search up the notes and check to see if there's any kind of pattern that I can use in order to make the program more concise.
